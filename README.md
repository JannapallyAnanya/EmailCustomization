PROJECT OVERVIEW

The Email Customization project is a web-based application designed to allow users to customize email templates by modifying content and applying different themes. The application consists of two main components: the Frontend and the Backend. The frontend is responsible for the user interface, while the backend handles the business logic and email customization functionalities.

Key Features
1.	Email Template Customization: Users can input custom text, choose email subjects, and select content like images or links to personalize their emails.
2.	Theme Customization: The application provides various pre-designed themes that users can apply to modify the look and feel of their emails.
3.	Real-time Preview: Users can instantly preview how the customized email will appear using a live preview feature.
4.	Responsive Interface: The web interface adjusts to different screen sizes, ensuring usability on both desktop and mobile devices.

Technologies and Tools Used
Frontend:
•	HTML/CSS: Used to create the structure and design of the web interface. CSS is utilized for styling the layout and ensuring a visually appealing email editor.
•	JavaScript: Enhances the interactivity of the application, particularly for the real-time preview functionality. It listens for user inputs (such as text changes or theme selection) and updates the preview accordingly.
•	Jinja2 Templating: Integrated with Flask to dynamically inject customized data into HTML templates. Jinja2 allows the email preview to reflect changes made by the user.

Backend:
•	Python: The backend of the application is built using Python, which handles all server-side logic and email processing.
•	Flask: Flask serves as the web framework, managing routes, handling HTTP requests, and rendering HTML templates. It also facilitates communication between the frontend and backend.
•	Database: A database (such as SQLite) can be used to store email templates and user preferences, allowing users to save their work and access it later.
•	SMTP: The Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is used for sending emails if integrated in the future. This protocol would allow users to send customized emails directly from the application.



Development Process

Frontend Development:
•	The user interface was created using HTML for structure and CSS for styling. JavaScript was added to enable real-time interaction with the email content, allowing users to preview their emails as they modify them.
•	Jinja2 templating is used to dynamically inject user input (such as custom text and theme selections) into the email preview.

Backend Development:
•	The backend is developed using Flask, which is responsible for processing user requests and rendering the correct templates.
•	The backend handles the core functionality, such as managing the email templates, customizing email content, and responding to user actions on the frontend.
•	User-generated email content is processed on the server-side to apply themes and generate a final email template.

Email Customization Logic:
The backend allows the customization of the email subject and body. The email content is dynamically rendered in the frontend using data passed from the backend.

Dashboard:
The email sent status and views will be tracked using the dashboard.
